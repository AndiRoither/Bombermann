As an alternative you can also start the server with the .bat files.

### INFO
Bombermann is undergoing constant change, so things might be buggy!
Preview page: [Page](https://andreasroither.github.io/Bombermann/) -> does not work without a running node js server.

### How-To

If you click the copy id button the game id will be copied to your clipboard. If you want others to join just send them the copied id.
